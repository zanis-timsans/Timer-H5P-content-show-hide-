# Timer-H5P-content-show-hide-
I created script for showing and hiding H5P content

It is a simple javascript + HTML&CSS. I used CSS parameter "visibility: hidden" instead of "display: none" for H5P content to avoid 0 height bug.

Simply download and run the "timer&H5P.html" file to see it in action.

Feel free to use for whatever you like.
